# Sign Language Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
The Sign Language Recognition System is an AI-based project that recognizes hand gestures of sign language and converts them into readable text. This system helps bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and normal users by enabling real-time gesture recognition using a webcam.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To assist deaf and mute individuals in effective communication  
- To recognize sign language gestures in real time  
- To apply Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts  
- To improve accessibility using computer vision techniques  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning (CNN)  
- NumPy  
- Webcam / Camera  

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. Capture real-time video input using a webcam  
2. Preprocess the image (resize, grayscale, noise removal)  
3. Detect hand region using computer vision techniques  
4. Classify gestures using a trained ML/DL model  
5. Display the recognized sign as text output

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition  
- High accuracy gesture classification  
- User-friendly interface  
- Supports predefined sign language gestures
